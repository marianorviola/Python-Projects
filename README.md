# I uploaded an Employee Attrition Prediction Model in Python (11/2/24). The model draws inferences on factors that could influence employees to either leave or stay in their current company. The employees in this model are call center employees. In general, call centers have high turnover rates, typically in the mid- to upper 20 percent. The prediction model was part of a report to assist the company in designing an effective employee retention policy. 
- uploaded a **Customer Segmentation Analysis** report (12/11/23) that uses 3 different ML classifier models (Hierarchical clustering, K-means and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)) to segment a customer data set into 4 distinct cluster groups. Each group is analyzed in detail and visualized in charts and graphs. 
- completed an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** (on 12/15/22) on the Titanic data set which predicts overall survival rates of various passenger categories.
- added a **Data Science project** (completed on 10/21/22) which was the capstone project from a data science team that I led during my post-grad certificate program (in Machine Learning and Data Science) at **the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee**. This was an on-line 6-month certificate program hosted by Coursera and taught by Professors from the Mathematics and Data Science faculty at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee.
