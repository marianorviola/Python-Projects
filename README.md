# Python-Projects is a portfolio of various Python projects that I have worked on. As more projects are completed, they will be added to this repository. 
- completed an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** (on 12/15/22) on the Titanic data set which predicts overall survival rates of various passenger categories.
- added a **Data Science project** (completed on 10/21/22) which was the capstone project from a data science team that I led during my post-grad certificate program (in Machine Learning and Data Science) at **the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee**. This was an on-line 6-month certificate program hosted by Coursera and taught by Professors from the Mathematics and Data Science faculty at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee.
