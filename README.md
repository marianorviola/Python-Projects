# I just uploaded a Customer Segmentation Analysis report to my Python-Projects portfolio. This report will help Companies know their customers better so they can develop a more targeted approach to reaching them.
- uploaded a **Customer Segmentation Analysis** report (12/11/23) that uses 3 different ML classifier models (Hierarchical clustering, K-means and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)) to segment a customer data set into 4 distinct cluster groups. Each group is analyzed in detail and visualized in charts and graphs. 
- completed an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** (on 12/15/22) on the Titanic data set which predicts overall survival rates of various passenger categories.
- added a **Data Science project** (completed on 10/21/22) which was the capstone project from a data science team that I led during my post-grad certificate program (in Machine Learning and Data Science) at **the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee**. This was an on-line 6-month certificate program hosted by Coursera and taught by Professors from the Mathematics and Data Science faculty at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee.
